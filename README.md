# Diabetes ML Model Training

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a diabetes dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) and training a machine learning model to predict the onset of diabetes. The dataset includes various medical attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, insulin, and age, which are used to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used as the development environment for running code and documenting analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array handling.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and exploring relationships between features.
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**: To build, train, and evaluate machine learning models.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded using Pandas from a CSV file.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Missing or inconsistent values were handled through methods like imputation or removal of records.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations were generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand the data and relationships between features.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: This includes normalization, feature scaling, and splitting the data into training and test sets.
5. **Model Selection**: Various machine learning models were trained and tested, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess model performance. Cross-validation was employed to ensure the model's robustness.

## Results

The best-performing model was evaluated using test data, and its performance was measured in terms of accuracy and other key metrics. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting diabetes based on medical data.

## How to Run
